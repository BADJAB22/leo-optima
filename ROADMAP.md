# 🗺️ LEO Optima: The Journey to Efficient AI

This roadmap outlines where we've been, where we are, and where we're going. LEO Optima is a community-driven project, and your feedback directly shapes this list!

---

## ✅ Phase 1: The Core Engine (Completed)
The goal was to build a mathematically sound, zero-dependency optimization layer.
- [x] **Lightweight Semantics**: Implementation of Johnson-Lindenstrauss Projection for fast, local embeddings.
- [x] **Smart Routing**: Development of the Novelty and Coherence engines to decide when to cache and when to call the API.
- [x] **Byzantine Consensus**: Multi-model verification for high-stakes queries.
- [x] **Verifiable Proofs**: Cryptographic proof fragments for every optimized response.

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Professionalization (Completed)
Making the engine ready for real-world developers.
- [x] **Community Dashboard**: A sleek React-based UI to visualize savings and performance.
- [x] **Multi-Tenant Identity**: Secure API key management for local multi-user setups.
- [x] **Docker Orchestration**: One-command deployment with Redis and Nginx.
- [x] **Streaming Support**: Full SSE support for that snappy "ChatGPT-like" typing experience.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Expansion (In Progress)
Broadening the horizons and making LEO even smarter.
- [ ] **Native Anthropic/Gemini Support**: Built-in adapters for the world's leading LLMs.
- [ ] **Local Model Integration**: Seamless fallback to Ollama/vLLM for ultra-low-cost "Draft" responses.
- [ ] **Advanced Prompt Compression**: Moving beyond simple word removal to intelligent, context-aware prompt slimming.
- [ ] **Plugin Architecture**: Allow the community to write their own "Optimization Strategies."

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: The Future Vision
- [ ] **On-Device Optimization**: Bringing LEO's intelligence to mobile and edge devices.
- [ ] **Decentralized Verification**: Using LEO's proof fragments for a global network of verifiable AI.
- [ ] **Auto-Tuning**: An AI that watches your traffic and automatically tunes its own thresholds for maximum ROI.
