# 🗺️ LEO Optima: The Path to Universal AI Efficiency

This roadmap outlines the evolution of **LEO Optima** from a core research project at **Kadropic Labs** to a global community-driven optimization standard.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Mathematical Foundation (Completed)
Establishing the core intelligence layer.
- [x] **Lightweight Semantics**: Implementation of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Projection engine.
- [x] **Smart Routing Architecture**: Development of Novelty and Coherence metrics for intelligent pathfinding.
- [x] **Byzantine-Robust Consensus**: Multi-model verification for high-stakes AI outputs.
- [x] **Verifiable Proof Fragments**: Cryptographic auditing for every optimized response.

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Production Readiness (Completed)
Making the engine accessible and monitorable.
- [x] **Kadropic Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of cost savings and performance.
- [x] **Identity & Quota Management**: Multi-tenant support for local orchestration.
- [x] **Full Stack Containerization**: One-command deployment via Docker Compose.
- [x] **Streaming Optimization**: Real-time SSE support for low-latency user experiences.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Global Expansion (In Progress)
Broadening support and deepening intelligence.
- [ ] **Native Multi-Provider Adapters**: Deep integration for Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, and Mistral.
- [ ] **Hybrid Cloud/Local Routing**: Automatic fallback to local models (Ollama/vLLM) for cost-zero drafting.
- [ ] **Context-Aware Prompt Compression**: Advanced NLP-based prompt slimming to reduce input tokens by up to 40%.
- [ ] **Developer Plugin System**: Enabling the community to build custom optimization "Hooks."

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: The Long-Term Vision
- [ ] **On-Device Optimization SDK**: Bringing LEO's intelligence to mobile and edge hardware.
- [ ] **Decentralized Verification Network**: Leveraging Proof Fragments for global AI auditability.
- [ ] **Self-Learning Thresholds**: Reinforcement learning to automatically tune optimization parameters for maximum ROI.
