*   **Regularly update dependencies**: Ensure all project dependencies are up-to-date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitor logs**: Regularly review application logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Restrict network access**: Limit access to the LEO Optima proxy and dashboard to trusted networks only.
